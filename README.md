# CS210Project
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project's goal is to take a file containing grocery items sold by a store in one day
  I used Python and C++ to calculate the frequency of each item sold as well as print an histogram of the data.
  
What did you do particularly well?
  I did a great job with my Python function.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I could have not used Python and I believe that it would lead to more secure and efficient code. 
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging pieces of code to write were the Python Functions because I kept getting the logic wrong in my loops, and I also forgot how to work with dictionaries in Python. It helped to google how to use dictionaries, and also to talk through the logic to a rubber Psyduck Pop figure. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I think that I got a much better understanding of function paramaters from this project believe it or not. The previous project confused me and a lot of the confusion    came from misunderstandings of functions, classes, paramaters, etc. And, while using this code to pass throught data to a different function and call data from         another function, it helped me better understand the paramaters in functions and what the uses were. As well as why I kept getting things wrong so much!!!

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I left inline comments on things that could confuse the reader
